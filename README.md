# fermentation-time
This project is a machine learning model for fermentation time binary classification based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The model uses techniques such as feature selection and cross-validation to predict the classification of fermentation time for a given sample. Dependencies Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

pandas: Used for data processing and reading CSV files. numpy: Used for numerical computation and array manipulation. scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks such as SVM classification, cross-validation, and feature selection. joblib: Used for saving and loading models.
